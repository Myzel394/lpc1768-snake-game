# Snake in C for the LPC1768

This is a small snake game for the LPC1768 microcontroller. It uses two buttons on PIN 6 and 16 to control the snake.
The game is displayed on a GDM2004D LCD display.

This game was developed as a side project to learn more about microcontrollers and embedded systems.
I created this in a few hours, so the code is not the best, but it works.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects.
